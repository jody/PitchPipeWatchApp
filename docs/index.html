    <h1>PitchPipe App Framework for Apple Watch</h1>
    <h2>Alpha 1.0.1</h2>
    <h3>Usability:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor usability!</li>
      <li>no instructions; non-obvious controls</li>
      <li>Hints:
        <ul>
          <li>Area above Play button is scrollable to reveal additional controls</li>
          <li>Clicking the multi-slider icon adds <em>Frequency</em> and <em>Volume</em> sliders below those controls</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functionality:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plays sine-wave tone</li>
      <li>Default tone is A4 based at 440Hz</li>
      <li>Button selectable notes: C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5</li>
      <li>Pitch frequency is modifiable by a slider</li>
      <li>Volume is modifiable by a slider</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Known Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See <em>Usability</em> above</li>
      <li>Tones have "cyclic clicking" (not always apparent at A4=440)
        <ul><li>
          This likely reflects the loop-based tone construction not matching sampling length
        </li></ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Known Missing Functionality:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow chromatic (not just diatonic)</li>
      <li>Greater range (not just C4 to C5)</li>
    </ul>
